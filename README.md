Untitled 2D Platformer (working title HazeStrider) is a single-level, 2D-platforming game in which the player navigates over a series of platforms in order to make it to the other side of the level. And can kill some slimes, if they really want to.

The game was made in Unity utilizing C# scripts, and frankly I'm not sure gitHub actually let me upload the darn thing but if it did! Simply click on the application to play. 

Controls:

WASD to move, Space to jump, F to attack. 

You can click on the lamppost at the start of the game to quit, and if you make it there click on the lamppost at the end of the level to restart.
